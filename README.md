Role tracking is disabled when any popular role mod is found, but you may need to disable it yourself.

Put `VanillaEnhancements.dll` in the **`BepInEx\plugins`** folder with other mods or download the zip package.
> [!Warning]
> The mod needs [BepInEx](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be) and [Reactor](https://github.com/nuclearpowered/reactor) to work properly. While **BepInEx** is used by every mod and shouldn't be a problem, without **Reactor** you can't launch the mod.
