## Configuration
You can configure everything in `BepInEx\config\VanillaEnhancements.cfg`, the mod's config.
It will be generated after the first launch and the changes you make need a restart to work


## Mod Support
Should work with 90% of mods.
Role tracking is disabled when any popular role mod is found, but you may need to disable it yourself.

## Downloading
Put `VanillaEnhancements.dll` in the **`BepInEx\plugins`** folder with other mods or download the zip package.
> [!Warning]
> The mod needs [BepInEx](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be) and [Reactor](https://github.com/nuclearpowered/reactor) to work properly. While **BepInEx** is used by every mod and shouldn't be a problem, without **Reactor** you can't launch the mod.
